# Minecraft Server Agents

This is a platform for RL agents in Minecraft that are controlled by the server.
It contrasts with Malm√∂ where each agent requires running a Minecraft client.
The goal is to have the following features:
* Many simultaneous agents
* Diverse tasks can be easily implemented (with different input / output spaces and different goals)
* Compatibility with various agent algorithms
* Ability to efficiently record human play
* Fast execution when learning
